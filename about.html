            Artist Statement
My work is a response to the invisible emotional and architectural structures that shape our perception of space, memory, and the self. Growing up in a family of painters in Bulgaria, I was surrounded by an intuitive visual language from an early age. I spent much of my childhood participating in plein air gatherings, where I developed a sensitivity to place, texture, and impermanence.
Trained in scenography at the Accademia di Belle Arti di Reggio Calabria in Italy, I approach painting and mixed media with a sense of constructed atmosphere—where composition becomes a stage for emotional and material exploration. I’m drawn to raw surfaces, fragmented forms, and the quiet poetry of decay. Through layering, deconstruction, and intuitive mark-making, I aim to create spaces that feel at once intimate and unfamiliar, where structure and abstraction coexist.
For me, making art is an ongoing process of navigating the tension between control and surrender, between what we build and what time eventually takes away.
